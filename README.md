# emaki

Official SDK for emaki (emaki.ai), the Japanese-language AI video generator for Seedance 2.5 and Seedance 2.0. Generate [Seedance 2.5](https://emaki.ai/seedance-2-5) and [Seedance 2.0](https://emaki.ai/seedance-2) clips, and images, from Elixir with the API key of your [emaki](https://emaki.ai/?utm_source=hex&utm_medium=package) account.

```elixir
{:ok, clip} = Emaki.generate_video("a paper lantern drifting down a night river, slow dolly-in")
# clip is the URL of the finished MP4
```

Each `generate` call submits the run, waits for it and returns the URL of the finished file. Every run costs credits on your emaki account, the same price as on the website.

## Install

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:emaki, "~> 0.1"}]
end
```

Elixir 1.18+; uses `:httpc` and the standard `JSON` module, no dependencies.

## API key

Sign up on [emaki.ai](https://emaki.ai/?utm_source=hex&utm_medium=package), create a key at [emaki.ai/settings/apikeys](https://emaki.ai/settings/apikeys), then pass it or export it:

```bash
export EMAKI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

A key runs on your account exactly like the site does: same models, same credits, and every run shows up in your library on emaki.ai.

## Video

The default model is `seedance_2_5` (5 seconds, 480p, 16:9, with sound). Parameters go in as a map and are passed through as-is:

```elixir
# Seedance 2.5: 8 seconds, 720p, vertical
Emaki.generate_video("a street drummer in the rain, handheld",
  %{"duration" => 8, "resolution" => "720p", "aspect_ratio" => "9:16"})

# Seedance 2.0
Emaki.generate_video("a koi pond seen from above, petals falling", %{"duration" => 5}, model: "seedance_2")
```

| model | what it is | main parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `seedance_2_5` | [Seedance 2.5](https://emaki.ai/seedance-2-5), the default | `duration` 4 to 30 · `resolution` 480p / 720p / 1080p · `aspect_ratio` 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:4, 9:16, 21:9, adaptive · `generate_audio` · `image` · `last_frame_image` |
| `seedance_2` | [Seedance 2.0](https://emaki.ai/seedance-2) | `duration` 4 to 15 · `resolution` 480p / 720p / 1080p · `aspect_ratio` · `generate_audio` · `image` |
| `seedance_2_fast` | Seedance 2.0 Fast | `duration` 4 to 15 · `resolution` 480p / 720p · `aspect_ratio` · `image` |
| `seedance_2_mini` | Seedance 2.0 Mini, the cheapest video model | same as Fast |
| `minimax_h3` | MiniMax H3 | `duration` 5 to 15 · `aspect_ratio` · `image` |
| `veo_3_1` | Veo 3.1 | `resolution` 720p / 1080p / 4k · `aspectRatio` 16:9 / 9:16 · `image` |

### Image to video

Pass `image`, a public https URL, and it becomes the first frame; the prompt then describes the motion. This is the same [image to video](https://emaki.ai/image-to-video) flow as on the site:

```elixir
Emaki.generate_video("the camera slowly orbits the statue", %{"image" => "https://example.com/statue.jpg"})
```

On Seedance 2.5, `last_frame_image` pins the closing frame as well.

## Images

The default image model is `nano_banana_2_lite`, the cheapest run on the site:

```elixir
{:ok, url} = Emaki.generate_image("a ramen stall in the rain, neon reflections")
Emaki.generate_image("a ukiyo-e style wave over a modern city", %{"aspect_ratio" => "16:9"}, model: "nano_banana_2")
```

Image models: `nano_banana_2_lite`, `nano_banana_2` (`resolution` 1K / 2K / 4K), `seedream_5_lite` (`quality` basic / high / ultra), `gpt_image_2` (`resolution` 1K / 2K / 4K). All take `aspect_ratio`.

## Submit now, collect later

```elixir
{:ok, id} = Emaki.submit("a fox trotting through fresh snow", "seedance_2_5")
{:ok, rec} = Emaki.status(id)   # rec["status"]: generating | completed | failed, rec["videoUrl"] when completed
{:ok, left} = Emaki.credits()   # free to call
```

Options: `api_key:`, `model:`, `timeout_ms:` (default 15 minutes) and `poll_ms:` (default 5000).

## Errors worth catching

Failures are `{:error, reason, message}`:

- `:auth`: no key, or the key is wrong or deleted (HTTP 401)
- `:quota`: not enough credits left for this run (HTTP 402)
- `:plan`: this model unlocks after the account has bought credits (HTTP 403)
- `:busy`: another generation on this account is still in progress (HTTP 409)
- `:rejected`: the content filter refused the prompt, or the account is cooling down after a refusal; reword rather than retry
- `:validation`: a parameter is missing or out of range; the message says which
- `:failed`: the run was accepted and then failed; the failure code says why
- `:timeout`: the wait ran out; the run may still finish in your emaki library

Anything else (a network failure, a 5xx) comes back as `:other` with the service's message.
